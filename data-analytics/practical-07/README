## Practical 7 – Regression Trees

This practical implements a regression tree from first principles using a greedy splitting strategy based on squared loss minimisation.

### Key tasks
- Represent tree nodes and regions
- Evaluate squared loss before and after splits
- Greedy selection of split feature and threshold
- Recursive tree growth with a maximum number of leaf nodes
- Prediction via tree traversal

### Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
