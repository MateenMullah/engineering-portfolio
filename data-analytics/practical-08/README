## Practical 8 – Decision Trees for Classification

This practical implements a decision tree classifier from first principles using Gini impurity to guide greedy splitting.

### Key tasks
- Represent tree nodes and leaf predictions
- Compute Gini impurity for classification
- Evaluate candidate splits across features and thresholds
- Grow a decision tree with a maximum number of leaf nodes
- Predict class labels via recursive tree traversal

### Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
