## PV Hosting Capacity Monte Carlo Time-Series Script

This script runs quasi-static time-series (QSTS) simulations in OpenDSS to evaluate photovoltaic (PV) hosting capacity on low-voltage distribution feeders using a Monte Carlo approach.

The script automates:
- Random PV placement on load buses
- Time-series simulation over a 24-hour period
- Voltage, voltage unbalance (VUF), and thermal limit checks
- Extraction of feeder, line, load, and substation metrics
- Export of results to CSV files and summary plots

## Requirements

- OpenDSS (installed with COM interface enabled)
- Python 3.x
- Python packages:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - pywin32

## Key User-Configurable Parameters

The following parameters should be modified by the user depending on the
feeder and study scenario:
- `START_HOUR`, `END_HOUR`, `TIMESTEP_MIN` – Simulation time settings
- `LOAD_SCALE_FACTOR` – Load scaling applied to the feeder
- `N_PV_SITES` – Number of PV systems to install
- `PV_BASE_KW` – Base PV system size
- `PV_SCALE_FACTORS` – PV penetration scenarios
- `ENABLE_VOLTVAR` – Enable/disable Volt/Var control
- `VMIN_LIM`, `VMAX_LIM`, `VUF_MAX` – Network constraint limits

---

## How to Run

1. Update the file paths and parameters in the **USER SETTINGS** section.
2. Ensure the selected OpenDSS feeder compiles without errors.
3. Run the script:
   python run_pv_hosting_capacity_qsts.py

## Use of AI Assistance

Parts of this script were developed with the assistance of AI-based tools for code structuring and debugging. All modelling decisions, simulation logic, and result interpretation were developed and validated by the author.
